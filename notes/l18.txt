Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, by Satoshi Nakamoto
2008

what's right/wrong with cash?
  +  portable
  +  cannot spend twice
  +  cannot repudiate after payment
  +  no need for trusted 3rd party
  +  anonymous (serial #s?)
  -  doesn't work online
  -  easy to steal
  +- hard to tax / monitor
  +- government can print more as economy expands

we want e-money; what about credit cards?
  (paypal and bank e-checks are similar)
  +  works online 
  +  hard to steal (a complex situation)
  +- can repudiate
  -  requires trusted 3rd party
  -  tracks all your purchases
  -  can prohibit some xactions (e.g. wikileaks donations)
  +- easy for government to monitor/tax/control

bitcoin: e-money without a central trusted party

what's hard technically?
  forgery
  double spending
  theft

what's hard socially/economically?
  why does it have value?
  how to convert?
  how to pay for infrastructure?
  monetary policy (intentional inflation &c)
  laws (taxes, laundering, drugs, terrorists)

basic bitcoin setup
  (all this for a simplified version of bitcoin)
  a network of bitcoin peers (servers) run by volunteers
    peers are not trusted: some may be corrupt
  each peer knows about all bitcoins and transactions
  transaction (sender -> receiver):
    sender sends transaction info to some peers
    peers flood transaction to all other peers
    receiver checks that lots of peers have seen transaction
    receiver checks that that bitcoin hasn't already been spent

transactions
  every bitcoin has a chain of transaction records
    one for each time this bitcoin was transferred as payment
  the bitcoin servers maintain the complete chain for every bitcoin
  chain helps ensure only owner spends

what's in a transaction record?
  public key of new owner
  hash of this bitcoin's previous transaction record
  signed by private key of previous owner

example:
  a bitcoin is owned by user Y (who received it in payment from X)
  T7: pub(Y), hash(T6), sig(X)
  Y buys a hamburger from Z and pays with this bit-coin
  Z needs to tell Y Z's public key (~~ bitcoin "address")
  Y creates a new transaction and signs it
  T8: pub(Z), hash(T7), sig(Y)
  Y sends T8 to bitcoin peers, which flood it
  honest peers verify that:
    no other transaction mentions hash(T7),
    T8's sig() corresponds to T7's pub()
  Z waits until lots of peers have seen/verified T8,
    verifies that T8's pub() is Z's public key,
    then Z gives hamburger to Y

notes:
  payment flows via peer network, not direct from Y to Z
  the "identity" of a bitcoin is the (hash of) its most recent xaction

why include pub(Z)?

why include hash(T7)?

why sign with sig(Y)?

does transaction chain prevent stealing?
  current owner's private key needed to sign next transaction
  danger: attacker can steal Z's private key
    Z uses private key a lot, so probably on his PC, easy to steal?

does design so far prevent double-spending? no!
  suppose Y creates two transactions for same bitcoin: Y->Z, Y->Q
  Z and Q probably don't check *all* the peers
    so Y has a chance to tell diff peers diff xactions
  maybe some peers are corrupt and cooperating with Y
    hide Y->Q from Z, hide Y->Z from Q
  even if peers know both transactions
    maybe it's not clear which is "first" and thus is the real transaction
  only need to play tricks briefly
    just until Z gives the hamburger to Y

what's needed?
  a strong notion of publishing
    either everyone sees xaction, or every doesn't see / ignores
    e.g. if Z sees Y->Z, Q sees Y->Z too
  a strong notion of order
    everyone agrees on which xaction came first, and which was dup
 
the block chain
  a copy stored in each peer
  each block:
    hash(prevblock)
    set of transactions
    nonce
  the order of blocks is implied by hash(prevblock)
    i.e. given the most recent block, you can find all prev blocks
  a transaction isn't real unless it's in the block chain
  new block every 10 minutes containing xactions since prev block

who creates each new block?
  i.e., who extends the chain?
  all the peers try
  requirement: hash(block) < "target"
  peers try nonce values until this works out
  can't predict a winning nonce, since cryptographic hash
  trying one nonce is fast, but only a few values will work
  it would take one CPU months to create one block
  but thousands of peers are working on it
  such that expected time to first to find is about 10 minutes
  the winner sends the new block to all peers
  (this is part of "mining")

how do transactions work w/ block chain?
  start: all peers know ...<-B5
    and are working on B6 (trying different nonces)
  Z sends public key (address) to Y
  Y sends Y->Z transaction to peers, which flood it
  peers buffer the transaction until B6 computed
  peers that heard Y->Z include it in next block
  so eventually ...<-B5<-B6<-B7, where B7 includes Y->Z

what if we want to double-spend?
  start with block chain ...<-B6
  Y gets Y->Z into block chain
    ...<-B6<-BZ (BZ contains Y->Z)
  Z will see Y->Z in chain and give Y a hamburger
  can Y create ...<-B6<-BQ
    and persuade peers to accept it in place of ...<-B6<-BZ?

when will a peer accept chain CX it hears from another peer?
  suppose peer already knows of chain CY
  it will accept CX if len(CX) > len(CY)
  and if CX passes some validity tests

so attacker needs a longer chain to double-spend
  e.g. ...<-B6<-BQ<-B8, which is longer than ...<-B6<-BZ
  and must create it in less than 10 minutes
    *before* main chain grows by another block
  10 minutes is the time it takes the 1000s of honest peers
    to find one block
  if the attacker has just one CPU, will take months to create
    the blocks, so no chance
    by that time the main chain will be much longer, and no peer
    will accept the attacker's shorter chain
  if the attacker has 1000s of CPUs -- more than all the honest
    bitcoin peers -- then the attacker can double spend
 
summary:
  attacker can force honest peers to switch chains if attacker
    controls majority of peer CPU power

how long should Z wait before giving Y the hamburger?
  until Z sees Y flood the transaction to many peers?
    no -- not in the chain, Y might flood conflicting xaction
  until Z sees one peer with chain ...<-BZ (containing Y->Z)?
    no -- maybe that peer is corrupt, in league with Y
  until Z sees lots of peers with chain ...<-BZ?
    maybe
    risky -- non-zero chance that some other chain will win
      i.e. some lucky machine discovered a few blocks in a row
        quickly, but its network msgs have so far been lots
      perhaps that chain won't have Y->Z
      probability goes down rapidly with number of blocks
  until Z sees chain with multiple blocks after BZ?
    yes -- slim chance attacker with few CPUs could catch up

validation checks:
  much of burden is on (honest) peers, to check new xactions/blocks
    to avoid ever having to scan the whole block chain
    and so that clients don't have to maintain the whole block chain
  peer, new xaction:
    no other transaction refers to same previous transaction
    signature is by private key of previous transaction
  peer, new block:
    hash value < target (i.e. nonce is right, proof of work)
    previous block hash exists
    new chain longer than current chain
    all transactions in block are valid
  Z:
    Y->Z is in a recent block
    multiple peers have accepted that block
    Z's public key / address is in the transaction
  (other stuff has to be checked as well, lots of details)

Q: what prevents a bad peer from modifying an existing block?

Q: 10 minutes is annoying; could it be made much shorter?

Q: are transactions anonymous?

Q: if I steal bitcoins, is it safe to spend them?

Q: what other attacks might work?

where does each bitcoin originally come from?
  each time a peer creates a block, it gets 25 bitcoins
    assuming it is the winner for that block
  it puts its public key in a special transaction in the block
  this is incentive for people to operate bitcoin peers
  but that number halves every 210,000 blocks (abt 4 years)

Q: how rich are you likely to get with one machine mining?

Q: if more people (CPUs) mine, will that create new bitcoin faster?

mining will stop after 21 million coins
  via the halving
  so the supply will eventually be fixed
  at that point block creator will get transaction fees

Q: why does it make sense for the mining reward to decrease with time?

Q: why mine at all? why not start with a fixed number of coins?

Q: is it a problem that there will be a fixed number of coins?

Q: what if the real economy grows (or shrinks)?

Q: why do bitcoins have value?
   $111 this morning; sadly $125 last week when I bought

Q: will we still need banks, credit cards, &c?
   today, dollar bills are only a small fraction of total money
   same may be true of bitcoin
   so properties of bitcoin (anonymity &c) may not be very important

Q: will bitcoin scale well?
   as transaction rate increases?
     claim CPU limits to 4,000 tps (signature checks)
     more than Visa but less than cash
   as block chain length increases?
     do you ever need to look at very old blocks?
     do you ever need to xfer the whole block chain?
